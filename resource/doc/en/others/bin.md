# Binary Packaging

Webman supports packaging a project into a single binary file, enabling webman to run on Linux systems without a PHP environment.

> **Note**
> The packaged file currently only supports running on x86_64 architecture Linux systems. Windows and macOS are not supported.
> You must disable the phar configuration option in `php.ini` by setting `phar.readonly = 0`.

## Install command line tool
`composer require webman/console`

## Packaging
Run the command
```
php webman build:bin
```
You can also specify which PHP version to package with, for example
```
php webman build:bin 8.1
```

After packaging, a `webman.bin` file will be generated in the build directory.

## Startup
Upload webman.bin to your Linux server and run `./webman.bin start` or `./webman.bin start -d` to start.

## Principle
* First, the local webman project is packaged into a phar file
* Then php8.x.micro.sfx is downloaded remotely to the local environment
* php8.x.micro.sfx and the phar file are concatenated into a single binary file

## Notes
* It is strongly recommended to use the same PHP version locally and for packaging (e.g. PHP 8.1 for both) to avoid compatibility issues
* Packaging will download PHP 8 source code but will not install it locally, so it will not affect your local PHP environment
* webman.bin currently only supports running on x86_64 architecture Linux systems and does not support macOS
* Packaged projects do not support reload; code updates require a restart
* By default the env file is not packaged (controlled by exclude_files in `config/plugin/webman/console/app.php`), so the env file should be placed in the same directory as webman.bin when starting
* A runtime directory is created in the directory where webman.bin resides during execution, used for storing log files
* Currently webman.bin does not read external php.ini files. To customize php.ini, set it in the custom_ini option in `config/plugin/webman/console/app.php`
* Some files do not need to be packaged; you can configure exclusions in `config/plugin/webman/console/app.php` to avoid an oversized package
* Binary packaging does not support Swoole coroutines
* Never store user-uploaded files inside the binary package. Operating on user-uploaded files via the `phar://` protocol is very dangerous (phar deserialization vulnerability). User-uploaded files must be stored separately on disk outside the package
* If your application needs to upload files to the public directory, extract the public directory to the same location as webman.bin, then configure `config/app.php` as follows and repackage:
```
'public_path' => base_path(false) . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'public',
```

## Download Standalone Static PHP
Sometimes you only want a PHP executable without deploying a full PHP environment. Click [here to download static PHP](https://www.workerman.net/download).

> **Tip**
> To specify a php.ini file for static PHP, use: `php -c /your/path/php.ini start.php start -d`
